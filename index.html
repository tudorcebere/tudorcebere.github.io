    <p> I am an third-year PhD student at Inria 🇫🇷, lucky to be supervised by Aurélien Bellet. Since, August 2024, I am also an Associate in Computer Science at Harvard, working with the OpenDP group. During my PhD, I visited the Vector Institute 🇨🇦 hosted by Nicolas Papernot and Harvard 🇺🇸 hosted by the OpenDP group.</p>
    <p>I am interested in differential privacy (DP) and its applications in creating trustworthy machine learning models. In particular, I am interested in the guarantees offered by differential privacy in various threat models and the associated practical guarantees, beyond the worst-case ones.</p>
    <p> I graduated from École normale supérieure de Lyon (ENS Lyon) with a masters in Theoretical CS, where I was fortunate to receive an Ampère Scholarship of Excellence. Before that, I received my BSc in EECS from Politehnica University of Bucharest 🇷🇴. </p>
    <p> I am always open for new collaborations or for advising motivated students for their BSc or MSc thesis. If interested, drop me an email at tudor dot cebere@inria.fr </p>
