      # 1) Check out code
      - name: Check out the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          persist-credentials: false  # We'll override credentials below

      # 2) Set up Ruby

        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.0'  # or whichever version you need

      # 3) Install dependencies (optional)
      #    If you have a Gemfile, bundler will install your gems. Otherwise, you
      #    could do `gem install jekyll rake` here. Adjust as needed.
      - name: Install gems
        run: |
          gem install bundler
          bundle install --path vendor/bundle

      # 4) Configure Git so the rake task can push. We replace "origin" with a
      #    token-based URL so that your `git push origin gh-pages` in Rakefile works.
      - name: Configure Git for pushing
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git remote set-url origin "https://${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/${{ github.repository }}.git"

      # 5) Run the Rake publish task
      - name: Publish to gh-pages
